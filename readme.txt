Air Purifiers!

These are the portable air purifiers I designed for myself. I think my plan right now is to do a blog going into more detail on these later, but here's the general idea!

These portable air purifiers are intended to be more performant than off the shelf ones at the expense of greater power use and noise, and while using relatively inexpensive off the shelf parts. The designs are made according to the best surface-level information I could learn about fluid dynamics, so I'm sure there's plenty of room for improvement, but they're ready to print and should perform nicely with good fans.

For the time being only the 60mm design is in a 'released' state. 

Required materials/resources:
- Filament 3D Printer
- 2x PC case fans per unit of the appropriate size and performance (strongly recommended to purchase ones with higher CFM and static pressure performance)
- One 'Pure Enrichment PureZone Mini' HEPA filter
- USB/TX3 power cable to power your fans (if your fans use TX3 connectors) (or however else you'd like to power them)
- Any USB power source
- Shoelaces (or whatever you want to hold them together, but I like shoelaces)

Licensing:
If anyone knows any licenses I can attach that leave room to explicitly forbid using the source for model training, please let me know. For now, while we wait for me to figure something out there, just know that these are released with no warranty; I don't guarantee that they will work, or that filtering the air will prevent any adverse outcome (or cause anything else to happen, for that matter), nor would I be at fault for anything that did (or didn't) happen.
