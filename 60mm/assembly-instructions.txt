Parts:
- One "Pure Enrichment PureZone Mini" HEPA filter (just the filter)
- One pair of shoelaces
- Two 60mm fans with TX3 connectors
- A USB to TX3 power cable (should be possible to find ones that support two fans per cable)

Parts recommendations:
I've had good luck with Startech "FAN6X25TX3H" 60x25mm fans

Printing recommendations:
flow-conditioner: Print 'upside down', with the topmost screw plane on the build plate. A raft isn't recommended; it can be hard to break off of this one.

filter-housing: Print at the given orientation. You should only need supports for the top screw plane

flow-conditioner-gap: Print at the given orientation

top: Print at the given orientation

Assembly:
This design stacks from bottom to top in this order:
1. Filter housing (with filter inside)
2. Flow conditioner
3. Flow conditioner gap
4. Fans
5. Top

I like to lace them up as I go, this way I can ensure each next part is nice and snug against the part below it. You could fasten this together with anything that fits through the (unthreaded) 'screw' holes, though I like the laces since the tension helps to keep everything where it's supposed to be. You can also pick whatever colors you want, which is fun :3
